I dual boot Windows 11 from time to time with Manjaro. Because I can't make X11 to work in Windows. The MS Visual Studio Code Editor is too complicated and I haven't played around too much with the settings of this great code editor.

My Windows 11 was upgraded successfully on August 01 2024 after purchasing it with 10 installed on it. My laptop costs $210 and I oreder it from AliExpress. It came with 256GB SSD, 12GB Ram, 4 cores and 4 threads and it has resolution of 1920x1080p.
