Since I moved my plain html website to blogpy I love it immediately and knew that I want to learn python, and on next day I purchased some Python books. The book that I am reading these days is called "Python For Dummies". I get bored from some time and need to distract myself. Found out that Google has made a Python video classes and I am watching at least 1 video per a day.

 Today I am so proud from myself, you might notice that my blog is having 4 pages - main page, archive page, forum page and error 404 page. Hm, since I created that forum page it does not get the content automatically updated, so the main and archive pages are updated automatically why do I have to add all the new content manually when I can try to edit build.py and adjust it to sync my forum page ? It sounds easy for someone that is familiar with Python, but for a newbie like me it sounds like a rocket science.

##Ninja IDE#

Nonetheless 3 days ago I downloaded an Python IDE called Ninja IDE and fixed a python script with zero knowledge over python with this ide, thankfully to pep8 errors that are displayed in real time. Must admit that I learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript in recent years.


I made few comments in the blogpy developer page, where I pointed few things which has to be corrected. Visiting the same website today I found out that he deleted my comments, but he fixed these things that I pointed.

I will not judge him for that, but from now on will post these contributions to MY website and then linking them as a comment there.

##The code#

For my forum page I use forum_build.py, which is copied & modified version of build.py - both files are stored in the same folder. If I want to update the posts for the forum page I do this:

```python
python2 forum_build.py
```
