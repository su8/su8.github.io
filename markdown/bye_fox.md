So two years ago I was so mad how broken the "stable" Chromium release was that I literary deleted Chromium and started using Firefox, (hint: fix-that-flat-app).

I would not learn about Edward Snowdens, neither care about my privacy if it wasn't the move to FF two years ago, as it opened my eyes.

Ironically yesterday I did the very same thing with Firefox.

The 46th FF release is the first one that's ported to use gtk3, but it's so unstable that I had to go back and use Extended Support Release. Every single click action is not registered after >= 10 minutes browser usage/idle, the settings do nothing when clicked, sometimes they open a new blank page, the browser ~~~cums~~~ crashes like crazy even without opening any website - just by being in idle, playing videos freezes the whole browser unless the video buffering has completed.

Playing YouTube videos only in 720p 30fps is not such an issue since the ESR release can't be forced to use gst-plugins-ffmpeg and have to rely on ~~~crap~~~ libav. Tweaking the **about:config** options to allow watching  1080p videos results in even bigger buffering nightmare. The jerky and choppy scrolling was the one that I had to get used from the very beginning two years ago.

I get used to most of the Firefox quirks over the time, but I had to call it quits with this instability in supposedly **stable** release.

I guess the pressure from not keeping their promise in range of 1 year or so to bring gtk3 port of FF with every next release have played them all.

So after reading about another eye [opener] I took the decision to switch and use other stable and popular browser.

Everything is replaceable, and so we can adapt to the changes.

As matter of fact I've never been a "fanboy" of any piece of code, what I use currently is my favourite code. When you have no emotions and personal feelings attached to something, the process of getting over it at some point is seamless.

What does the Chrome/Chromium eat for breakfast ? For sure I can't measure the startup time in seconds anymore. Heck I can't even lift my finger off the Enter key before the browser is already started.
