Just wow. Can't number how many of the changes in my blog are driven by the mobile needs.

Yesterday or the day before that found a typo in my one of my blog posts and wanted to fix the typo from my phone. So I had to fire up some text editor and manually browse the markdown directory and edit the post.

Once the typo was fixed, the idea to have in-browser live post editing hit me like a tornado.

Post editing button, see my [Archive](#!archive) page.

I can edit the markdown source, hit the preview button and see instantly how my blog post will look like after the chages, clicking it again brings me back to the markdown.

Preview clicked.

At the bottom below the text editor I've placed a download button.

Download button clicked.

I won't add "New Post" button. There are so many variables the things can go wrong: crashed browser, somebody gives you call, your mobile devices reboots itself, runs out of power, etc will not have your post saved [in case you didn't clicked "Download" before the event]. So stick to some editor and be safe.

When you have a mouse and full-sized keyboard the editing process is seamless, but on mobile devices...
