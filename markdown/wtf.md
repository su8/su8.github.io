**update** Two days later the TLDs was returned to noip and my subdomain is working flawlessly.

My lovely 3 years old subdomain was hijacked along with 21 more subdomains from the company that I don't want to mention anymore.

No-ip served me pretty well all those years, even as a loyal client they sent me 3 stickers.

As you probably heard or not, on June 30th 2014, after the rumors that no-ip has been used by 2 botnets to damage more than 7 million personal computers by infecting them with malwares, a federal court has given permission to be seized 22 of the no-ip subdomains.

I don't know who is right or wrong, but I know that 3 years of my life has gone with a finger snap. I've survived hacked wordpress account, migration over different hosting providers, cms, and hand written pages. I can't take it anymore, honestly my domain name and my loyal visitors was the only thing that  kept me smiling and being creative.

Dunno what to say, my heart is bleeding and I'm so mad that my hands are tied.
