Should I continue learning more rust after porting the code behind https://github.com/su8/nitruks twice, once in the `README.md` and the other one in `old_main.rs` ?

For the basic work that `nitruks` is doing, I had no problems porting it to rust twice.

My first real programming language was python dating back to July 2013. Then in January 2015 I learned C and ported my python https://github.com/su8/pdf2png to https://github.com/su8/pdf2img-c and after that I contributed code to screenfetch-c https://github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c/pull/11 https://github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c/pull/12 and stick with the C language till 2018 when my desktop pc died. In May 2022 I purchased a laptop for $200 and with my C knowledge I started using C++ and created https://github.com/su8/hackzy which was written till the 59th commit on my tablet.

Learned a lot C++ and I like it, without C I wouldn't be able to learn C++ that fast.

What's your opinion, go further with rust or stick with python/c/c++ for now ?
