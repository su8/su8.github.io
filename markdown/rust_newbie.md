Should I continue learning more rust after porting the code behind https://github.com/su8/nitruks twice, once in the `README.md` and the other one in `old_main.rs` ?

For the basic work that `nitruks` is doing, I had no problems porting it to rust twice.

My first real programming language was python dating back to July 2013. Then in December 2014 I learned C and ported my python https://github.com/su8/pdf2png to https://github.com/su8/pdf2img-c (here's the ChangeLog because I had no internet in home that time - https://github.com/su8/pdf2img-c/blob/master/doc/ChangeLog) and after that in January 2015 I contributed code to screenfetch-c https://github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c/pull/11 https://github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c/pull/12, learned a lot of C and how to use one `struct` to hold all of the distros information - https://github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c/blob/c2d9308db568dfd513822d7ac9792fe02849be23/src/structs.h .I stuck with the C language till 2018 (in 2017 up until 2018 I became `conky` contributor - https://github.com/su8/conky where you can see my branches which still are not merged, there are commits which was commited by `lasers` and he joined my commits into his own `push` , so if you search for my commits only you won't find all of work for `conky`) when my desktop pc died. In May 2022 I purchased a laptop for $200 and with my C knowledge I started using C++ and created https://github.com/su8/hackzy which was written till the 59th commit on my tablet.

Learned a lot C++ and I like it, without C I wouldn't be able to learn C++ that fast.

What's your opinion, go further with rust or stick with python/c/c++ for now ?
