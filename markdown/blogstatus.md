My blog was unreachble for about 5 years, because github changed how static website can be deployed.

And your website can be deployed by visting https://github.com/su8/YOUR_ACCOUNT.github.io/settings/pages . Now it's not enough to have ACCOUNT.github .io/.com repository. You must visit the Settings -> Pages and click the deploy static website which will create a run-time checks everytime you update this repository.

>Your site was last deployed to the github-pages environment by the Deploy static content to Pages workflow.
