January and February was the most busiest months in my life.

However in range of 3 weeks I managed to contribute to screenfetch-c.

4000+ changes separated in 5 commits. By the time of writing, not all changes was pushed to the [screenfetch-c](https://github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c) master branch. 

There is the link to my improved screenfetch-c fork - [https://github.com/wifiextender/screenfetch-c](https://github.com/wifiextender/screenfetch-c) 

If anyone had any doubts about my previous blog post where I shared my uname implementation and announced [https://github.com/wifiextender/pdf2img-c](https://github.com/wifiextender/pdf2img-c), the contributions to screenfetch-c will be enough to prove my knowledge in C.

Let me know guys if you want to start a tutorial series regarding Linux From Scratch.
