Instead programming GUI applications with QPython, you would like to use the interpreter to run your scripts.

To achive this, you should download [Python3ForAndroid.apk](https://code.google.com/p/python-for-android/downloads/detail?name=Python3ForAndroid_r6.apk) and install it first. 

Make sure that you've enabled "install apps from unknown sources" in your device Settings.

Get a [terminal emulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm) and some [text editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.sblo.pandora.jota)

Type the following in the text editor and save it as "python3" in your /sdcard/
