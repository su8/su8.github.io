It all started as joke to include fake log-in form, but what I just added will blow your mind.

Used the GitHub api to make the post and config.js submission as simple as pressing single button. No need to submit my posts and config.js by hand anymore.

Other static blog/website/whatever generators will be jelly because they'll have "render" the posts locally in order to include your latest additions, but geminiblog isn't one of them. All the rendering happens on the client side.

I also added 3 more themes, per post Author, per post Date and several other small changes.

The images in this post hinted me that I have to also include image uploader [not base64 inlined ofc.] More buttons, more styling.

Post edit:

Added pop-up/modal dialogue for file submission to GitHub to the following pages: settings, new post, edit post.

It's really neat looking responsive dialogue that's part of the bootstrap framework, hats off to stackoverflow and their hint on how to trigger the dialogue without using the bootstrap javascript library.
