Since my previous post I updated a few things in my blog. Listing them in no particular order.

The search form is now interactive. Once you start typing it will show you the results instantly. Especially useful on mobile devices.

The **tags** are returned after giving them some serious thought. Let me show you what I wanted to avoid with the following example borrowed from the net. Hint: the more tags you add the more you'll confuse your visitors.

The tags are renamed to "Categories". Each category has it's own row and beside it there is a small colorized badge that shows how many entries are in each category.

##My Blog themes in preview##

Will show you what themes my blog have been using during 2013-2016. I couldn't find my wordpress, octopress and blogpy transition themes. That's is why I have go back only to 2013.

Used the [Halftone](http://luiszuno.com/blog/downloads/halftone-html-template/) theme during September 2013 - March 2014.

In order to celebrate my first (2014) year as GitHub user I used the bootstrap framework for very first time to build my blog layout and theme the way I wanted to. Below are two pictures showing what distributions I've been using.

March 2014 - March 2016

Last, but not least is that I'm reusing [cyborg](https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/) again. Thank god that I followed the standards this time when I transittioned the default geminiblog theme to the bootstrap framework.

It's so easy to swap and try new themes now, all I had to do is point the new theme location in my `index.html` file, e.g: https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/bootstrap.min.css , reload the page and see whether I want to use it.

Post edit:

Added glyphicons to the Home and Archive buttons, replaced the search button glyphicon with console one.

The blog layout is using multiple column classes, e.g: `col-md` and `col-sm`.

Looking forward to see and use stable bootstrap v4 release.
