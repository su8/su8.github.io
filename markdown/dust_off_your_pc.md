I always keep my promises and the one two months ago is not exception.

Let's have a look inside of an ordinary computer and find out how to clean it.

If you drop by and request us to clean your computer, we will charge you $10.

As you are about to learn, there is nothing difficult to do this on your own.

Before you begin, make sure that you got the following nearby: cotton buds, baby wipes or compressor, tissues (not for wiping noses), thermal paste, 100% pure alchocol (nail polish remover won't work), magnetic screwdriver, empty container to store the screws, pliers (optional), cable ties (optional).

Start by unscrewing your computer case side panels.
 Now unscrew all fans and take them out of the case.

Unplug all cables connected to the motherboard and move them aside. If you got external graphics card unscrew it and take it out.

After that **gently** unscrew the motherboard screws, once completed take the motherboard out of the case.

Unscrew and take out the rest hardware: HDD, SSD, power supply unit, dvd writter, card reader and so on.

If you got compressor, go to a well ventillated area (perharps somewhere outside) and blow the dust from the computer case and it's side panels, otherwise use baby wipes.

Do not use the compressor to blow the dust from your motherboard and psu!

Getting ready to clean the fans. What we will use: cotton buds, 100% pure alchocol. Pour out small ammount alchocol in a cup, dip the cotton buds in the cup and clean the fan blades.

Use baby wipes to clean your HDD, SSD, power supply unit, dvd writter, card reader and so on.

Getting ready to exchange the central processing unit thermal paste.

Unplug the 3/4-pin fan. If you got aftermarkert cooler flip the motherboard and unscrew the screws from the backplate.

Take out the fan(s) from the heatsink and clean them as described earlier. Use compressor to blow the dust out of the heatsink.

Get the bottle with pure alchocol and soak a tissue. While the cpu is **locked** in the socket, use the tissue to wipe the thermal paste.

The pressure comming from the heatsink is enough to spread the thermal paste equally, if you insert too much paste it might leak. The purpose of the thermal paste is not to cool your CPU but to fill the microscopic gaps that your brushed cpu cap and heatsink has. So the heat transfer between the cpu cap and heatsink will be improved. If you insert too much paste (and the opposite) the CPU temperature will be higher, applying the right ammount of paste is **"try and see"**.

Now reapply the thermal thermal paste. Do not insert too much paste, a small pea size drop is enough ! Xenon and Opteron CPUs are quiet big, so they require a little bit more paste.

Making spiral SATA cables. Get a flashlight/pen and heavy screwdriver. Wrap one SATA cable around the flashlight/pen and use the screwdriver to hold the flashlight/pen on it's place, because the SATA cable will want to restore it's original shape. Wait around 1 minute and see the results, repeat the steps for each SATA cable.

At this stage, return everything back to your computer case. Hide the unused PSU cables - below or above your dvd writter, it's win win situtaion because the airflow and overall look will be improved.

Here is the final result: shiny computer.

If you are about to purchase RAM, pay attention what's the RAM profile - low or high. Bought a pair of corsair vengeance, but the sticks was high profile, and the stick that's closer to the cpu heatsink couldn't fit because it was at the same high as my aftermarket cooler fins, so I had to buy single RAM stick that's low profile.

I got spare cpu, ram, hdd, psu, mb and case for each of my servers.

Remember practice makes perfection, and the only way to do something correctly is to find it's limits, or should I say to do it the wrong way.

Don't hesitate to pay more than $100 for PSU, it is the base that supplies proven and reliable electricity to your computer parts, so don't get cheap.

If you buy $30 cpu, don't purchase $300 graphics card, otherwise you'll be in trouble - cpu bottleneck, and your graphics card will die in range of 1 month.

The best investment == monitor. Always prefer SSD over HDD.

Clean your computer every 6 months. The keyboard, mouse and monitor should be cleaned everyday.

Avoid buying laptops. If something gets broken you can't order the part in ebay, otherwise the laptop warranty will be voided. Laptop parts are quiet expensive and only the laptop manufactor can supply the needed part.
