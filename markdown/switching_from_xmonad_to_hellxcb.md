Just found out that there are monsterwm and monsterwm-xcb and forked them, actually I forked many window managers and the one that catched my eye was FrankenWM and forked it and renamed my fork to frincklewm, and couple hours later I decided to give monsterwm-xcb a try and suited my needs pretty well and this will be my daily driver for now. 

Configured it to act as xmonad and I'm glad that it has some space by default on top of the windows that act as panel, so https://github.com/su8/doomy can be feeded by scripts or https://github.com/su8/pinky-bar

Here's a link to my [hellxcb](https://github.com/su8/hellxcb) fork of monsterwm-xcb.
