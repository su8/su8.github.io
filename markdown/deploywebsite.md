GitHub changed the way how a static website is build and deployed.

Back in 2015 the way was to name your github repo with `username.github.io/com` and you must to create a `gh-pages` branch.

This was dropped and you don't have to create this `gh-pages` branch.

The way now is to click on `YourRepos->Settings->Pages` and:

Choose the GitHub Actions and choose which branch you want to be used:

Click **Save** and it should be up and running.
