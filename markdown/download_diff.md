Having a fork of some git repo and want to try the pull request changes in the upstream repo ?

Here's how to download a diff file with all of the changes in a single file. **1** is the number of the desired pull request, type the number and not the title of the pull request.

```bash
wget https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY/pull/1.diff
```
