I'm back after 6 years dating back to 2018 and having only my phone and tablet I barely made any programs.

On May 24, 2022 I created https://github.com/su8/hackzy which was written by my tablet up until the 59th commit, afterwards the game is written from my brand new windows laptop.

On Nov 1, 2022 I created https://github.com/su8/kurger which all I had to do is to port it from https://github.com/su8/pdf2img-c. The C version is using gtk3 and the kurger one is using Qt. Ported it to windows too.

On Nov 25, 2022 I started contributing code to https://github.com/su8/starfetch , all in all 45 commits was pushed by me. The original author get in touch with me and thanked for the work in his project.

On Aug 02 2024 I created https://github.com/su8/doomy , a statusline/bar written in X11 and it does simply work out of the box. Several days lated I added run-time options instead hardcoding the text/background colours, fonts, bar height and putted them in Makefile and they was compiled and passed with the `-D` flag to the program.

On Aug 05 2024 I created https://github.com/su8/lunnisWM , dead simple window manager written in c++, based on steveWM
