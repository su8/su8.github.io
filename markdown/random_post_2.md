In this post we are going to discuss the recent events that took place in internet.

Let's begin with some great news about this blog.

I have never spoke about the updated template in this blog.

It all began one year ago when I was looking for template replacement in order to celebrate my first year as GitHub user.

I knew that the template have to be written in html5, responsive, free and open source.

I gave up after several wasted days in the search engines.

On next week found out bootstrap theme called [Cyborg](http://bootswatch.com/cyborg/) and realised that I can use it and write the wanted template they way I want to.

The template's source code was just barebone boostrap CSS with several specific tweaks. No php, html5 or whatsoever starting point that would guide you how to build your own template and integrate it in your blog.

I knew what the final result should look like. Thankfully to my html and css skills, in range of exactly 4 days I managed to build the template which you currently see, while stripping all the unnecessary bootstrap weight from it.

The final result performed via different speed tests was out bloody standing, let me show you (one year later):

Loading time: under 100ms, html and css are validated by W3C, passing all the different tests with at least 96/100 score.

What I have learnt is that if you want something free and **unique**, you have to rely on your own knowledge to make it happen.

Allright, moving to the recent events.

When I read about the end of [#!](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=38916) it made me sad. I have never used #!, but it is pitty to see 6 years old Debian derivative go when it have so many users, fans and history behind, and they always listened it is community and never betrayed them for corporate interests.

The macintosh distro err the mentalOS err elementaryOS devs freaked out and posted their thoughts in a blog post insulting everyone with the words **"You are a cheater if you download ElementryOS for free"**, their Debian->Ubuntu->elementaryOS distribution is made of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), 'nuff said.

Even the most popular encryption GNU PGP project called GnuPG lacked funds, please read [http://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke](http://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke), then compare the whole story written there with the one behind the mental people err elementaryOS.

Last but not least, the attempts of Not Secure Agency that became popular around the invention of ice cream (just kidding) to continue what it has been doing for past 10 years - intercepting everyones internet and devices, conducting bulk collection of personal metadata, breaking into everyone's devices without obtaining warrant.

Basically their broad and propaganda statements like "no one is above the law", "we don't want backdoor, we want the front door" or by calling everyone terrorist, peadophile, kidnapper, they want to make you feel bad and "cooperate" to enslave you.

There is constitutional process of obtaining a search warrant, and all the agencies want to skip that process/documentation and conduct mass surveillance **without your knowledge**, so when they fail to find evidences no one will be held responsible and the fail won't be criticized by the tax payers (everyone that works and is paying all the taxes), that's like being proven guilty for something without been given a chance to defend yourself via lawyer.

For past 10 years, since 9/11, no terrorist has been caught or stopped by the mass surveillance, even the one from India's 9/11 where they had all the indicators to prevent it. All they doing is harming everyone's privacy, spending our money without **any** positive results. Since World War 2 onwards, NSA have [caused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip) more harm than results to the American people.

NSA cries to all the Jihad Central Head Quarters, Criminal Instigation Agency and United Kingdom of America to crown it for another decade.

Every agency in the US is trying to figure out how to impose a ban on all the encryption software that exists, which is why [PGP](http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html) was created back the '90s.

I like how the US goverment is trying to ban or put "front door" in the encryption software, the last time they conducted mass surveillance resulted in the PGP birth. I like how the need is forcing us to be creative in such crucial moments.

I was in doubt when the news broke that UK is [unable](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/uk-parliament-says-its-technologically-infeasible-to-block-tor-online-anonymity-systems/) to block the access to the Tor network, thought they are fooling us and stopped using Tor up until the news that every encryption software is working and drives the feds crazy, because they are unable to do their unreasonable warrantless wiretapping duties.
