I am proud to announce that my planned project has been born - [Blogfy](https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy).

The point of my project is to ease everyone that wants to have a simple static blog without the need to use php nor databases or some knowledge over the programming laguages. 

Blogfy is my first project I've ever created and it's based on Blogpy, instead waiting my contributions to be inserted in Blogpy I decided to create my own project and maintain it.

Blogfy offers 3 themes out of the box and guides how to change things if you wish to modify some of the files, also recorded two videos for quick startup. Blogfy is available for Windows and Linux.

Blogfy - blog for you
